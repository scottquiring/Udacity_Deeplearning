    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label."

The film is truly original and was so dark & sinister that gives the tensive mood also it is emotionally & psychologically thrilling, the whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense and seems like it's really happening. It's amazing that how they managed to make an 80 minute movie with just a guy in a phone booth but the full credit goes to Colin Farrell and Larry Cohen the writer not Joel Schumacher because he is a crappy director. Joel Schumacher's films are rubbish especially The Number 23, Phone Booth was shot in 10 days with a budget of $10 million so it wasn't a hard job to make it, that's why Joel doesn't get any credit but the cast & crew did a fantastic job. I also really liked the raspberry coloured shirt Colin was wearing and it was an excellent choice of clothing because the viewers are going to watch him throughout the whole film. When I first saw the movie I fell in love with it and I bought it on DVD the next day and I've seen it about 20 times and I'm still not fed up with it. Phone Booth is and always will be Colin Farrell's best film! Overall it is simply one of my favourite films and I even argued over my friend because he didn't like it.\n",

Not only is Vikings a series that is a joy to watch, it is also a series that is easy to recommend. I personally feel that the creator and producers did a fine job of giving the viewer quality material. Now, there are a few inconsistencies with the series, most notably would be the idea that Vikings had very little knowledge of other European countries and were amazed by these people across the big waters. In reality Vikings engaged in somewhat normal commercial activities with other Anglo-Saxons, so the idea that Vikings were as amazed as they seemed when they realize that other people were out there is not that realistic. However, it is this small inconsistency that goes a long way in holding the premise together. I simply love the series and would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a quality show.\"\"\")"

    "TestSomeText(\"\"\"This movie didn't feel any different from the other anime movies out there. Sure, the sibling dynamics were good, as well as the family values, the childhood memories and older brother anxiety. The main idea was interesting, with the new baby seeming rather like a boss sent into the family to spy on the parents and solve a big problem for his company. You can't help but identify with the older kid, especially if you have younger siblings. But eventually, the action was a bit main stream. The action scenes were not original and kind of boring. Other than that, the story became a little complicated when you start to think about what's real and what's not. The narration was good and the animation was nice, with the cute babies and puppies. So, 4 out of 10.\n",
